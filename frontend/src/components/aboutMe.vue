        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Lê Quang Phúc, my studentId is 001282874-gcs220005, and I am currently a student at the
            University of Greenwich, pursuing the COMP1842 course. I am deeply passionate about web and mobile
            programming and have been actively involved in various projects that showcase my skills and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>During my time at the University of Greenwich, I have gained valuable experience in developing web
            applications, mobile apps, and working with different technologies. My academic journey has allowed me
            to explore various aspects of programming, from front-end development to back-end systems.</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy working on personal projects, contributing to open-source communities, and
            staying updated with the latest trends in technology. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance
            my knowledge and skills, and I am excited about the future possibilities in the field of programming.
        </p>
